# Hi there! 👋 

## 👇 Whoami 
My name is **João Santos** and I'm a Frontend developer currently based in Portugal. 
I am a fast-learner and hardworking team player, who is passionate about working independently and learning new technologies.
I've been working in a full remote mode for over a year now, and I'm currently looking for a new challenge outside my country.

## 👨‍💻 Skills 
Daily working in a React application with Hooks, Redux, Sagas, SASS, Axios and some other technologies. 
Currently learning more about Nodejs, Express, Mongoose and Apollo Graphql. Check my latest project: [The market](https://grocery-jopms.netlify.app/).
